--Exercise--

Select the first name, last name, salary and salary grade of employees whose salary fits between the lower_limit and upper_limit from the salgrade table.

--Solution--

SELECT
e.first_name,
e.last_name,
e.salary,
s.grade

FROM employee as e

INNER JOIN salgrade as s
ON e.salary BETWEEN s.lower_limit AND s.upper_limit    

--eventhough the 2 tables does not have a common column to join, ON can also be used to compare between 2 tabes. :D
