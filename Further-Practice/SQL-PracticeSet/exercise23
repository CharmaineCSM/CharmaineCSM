--Exercise--

Select the name of each product category and the revenue (name that column revenue) that it generated. 
Sort the results by revenue in descending order.

Show a product category even if there were no sales for a particular category. In this case, the revenue is null.

--Solution--
SELECT cat.name, 
SUM(oi.price) AS revenue

From categories cat 

LEFT JOIN products p  --Use left join because we need to display the nulls of products with no sales 
ON cat.id = p.category_id

LEFT JOIN order_items oi 
ON oi.product_id = p.id

GROUP BY 1 --group by the first column, which is category names
ORDER BY revenue desc
